## 🚀 Features
- **Data Handling**: Organized directories for raw, processed, and external datasets.
- **Modularity**: Separate scripts for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjustable hyperparameters via configuration files.
- **Reproducibility**: Experiment logging and checkpoint saving.
- **Scalability**: Support for large-scale data and distributed training.
- **Testable**: Unit testing to ensure reliability.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Place raw data in the `data/raw/` directory.
   - Use preprocessing scripts in `src/data/` to clean and transform the data.

---

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Data Preparation
Run preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the dataset:
```bash
python src/data/preprocess.py --config configs/preprocess.yaml
```

### 2. Training
Train the model with specified hyperparameters:
```bash
python src/training/train.py --config configs/train.yaml
```

### 3. Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on a test set:
```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate.py --config configs/eval.yaml
```

### 4. Deployment
Export the model for deployment:
```bash
python src/deployment/export_model.py --model-path experiments/model_checkpoint.pth
```

Here's an updated section for your README file that documents the version-related error and its resolution:

### 🛠 Known Issues and Resolutions

#### **Issue: `'super' object has no attribute '__sklearn_tags__'`**
This error occurs when using **XGBoost** with certain versions of **Scikit-learn** due to compatibility issues in how the Scikit-learn API interacts with the XGBoost implementation.

#### **Root Cause**
The `__sklearn_tags__` attribute is part of Scikit-learn’s internal validation mechanism introduced in newer versions. Older versions of XGBoost are not fully compatible with Scikit-learn versions `>=1.2.0`.

#### **Solution**
Ensure that you are using compatible library versions:
- **XGBoost**: `>=1.6.0`
- **Scikit-learn**: `==1.5.2`

Run the following commands to upgrade to the correct versions:
```bash
pip install --upgrade xgboost scikit-learn
```

#### **Example Environment**
Below is an example of a working environment where the error is resolved:
- Python: `>=3.8`
- XGBoost: `1.6.0` or later
- Scikit-learn: `1.5.2`

#### **Summary**
Using **XGBoost >=1.6.0** with **Scikit-learn 1.5.2** resolves the `'__sklearn_tags__'` error. Ensure these versions are specified in your `requirements.txt` or environment setup scripts.

---

### Updated Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
```plaintext
scikit-learn==1.5.2
xgboost>=1.6.0
```

Here’s how you can document the **CatBoost and NumPy compatibility issue** in a README-friendly format:

---

### 🛠 Known Issues and Resolutions

#### **Issue: CatBoost Compatibility with NumPy 2**
When using **CatBoost**, you might encounter an error related to NumPy compatibility:

#### **Root Cause**
CatBoost versions require NumPy `>=1.26.4` for compatibility with newer releases. If your environment uses an older version of NumPy or an incompatible version of CatBoost, this error will occur.

#### **Solution**
Ensure the correct version of NumPy is installed alongside a compatible CatBoost version:
- **NumPy**: `>=1.26.4`
- **CatBoost**: `>=1.2`

Run the following command to resolve the issue:
```bash
pip install --upgrade numpy catboost
```

---

### Example Environment
Below is an example of a working environment configuration:
- Python: `>=3.8`
- NumPy: `>=1.26.4`
- CatBoost: `>=1.2`

---

### Updated Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
To ensure compatibility, specify these dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:
```plaintext
numpy>=1.26.4
```

## 🏆 Best Practices
- **Version Control**: Track data, models, and configurations with versioning tools like DVC or Git.
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, modular, and documented code.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use tools like MLflow, TensorBoard, or Weights & Biases to log experiments.
- **Reproducibility**: Keep dependencies pinned and configurations consistent.
